espresso=Espresso
espresso.content=Espresso is a concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso often has a thicker consistency than coffee brewed by other methods, a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and crema (foam). As a result of the pressurized brewing process the flavours and chemicals in a typical cup of coffee are very concentrated. Espresso is the base for other drinks, such as a latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, or americano. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most beverages, but the usual serving size is smaller\u2014a 30 mL (1 US fluid ounce) shot of espresso has 40 to 75 mg of caffeine, which is less than half the caffeine of a standard 240 mL (8 US fluid ounces) cup of drip-brewed coffee. A professional operator of an espresso machine is a barista, the Italian word for bartender. 
americano=Americano
americano.content=Caffe Americano, or Americano (Italian: American coffee) is a style of coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso, giving a similar strength but different flavor from regular drip coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. In the United States, "Americano" is used broadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order, but in a narrower definition it refers to adding water to espresso (espresso on the bottom), while adding espresso to water (espresso on the top) is instead referred to as a long black. 
latte=Latte
latte.content=A latte (from the Italian caff\u00e8 latte or caffellatte pronounced [\u02cckaffel\u02c8latte], meaning "coffee [and] milk") is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk or soy milk. Variants include replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai, mate or matcha. When used in English, the word is also sometimes spelled latt\u00e9 or latt\u00e8\u2014the diacritical mark being added as a hyperforeignism.
cappuccino=Cappuccino
cappuccino.content=A cappuccino (Italian pronunciation: [kapput\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0no], English pronunciation: /\u02cck\u00e6p\u0259\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0no\u028a/, meaning "Capuchin" or literally "small cap") is an Italian coffee drink prepared with espresso, hot milk, and steamed-milk foam. The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits.
